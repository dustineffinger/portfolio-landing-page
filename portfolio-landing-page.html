      <p>I'm 23 years old and working hard to create a path in life that's
        sustainable, and where I can thrive.
        That's why I'm here at Epicodus. Music is my passion, and I want to be
        able to pursue that freely with a career that can support it.
        I also want to work in a field where I'm constantly pushed to learn
        new and challenging concepts, allows me to creatively solve problems,
        and can do some real good in the world. And maybe someday allow me the
        financial freedom to own a cat-farm for strays. Here is a complete list
        of all of my hobbies!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Playing Music</li>
        <li>Riding Bichael</li>
        <li><em>Befriending Every Cat I See</em></li>
        <li>Coding!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/dustineffinger/no-more-honey" target="_blank">No! More! Honey!</a></h3>
      <p>No More Honey was a fun practice-project we created in order to
        familiarize ourselves with HTML formatting, as well as CSS styling.
        The idea was to create a blog-post about alternatives to honey, for the
        greater good of the environment :)

      <h3> <a href="https://github.com/dustineffinger/cookie-recipe" target="_blank">Wonderful Muffin Recipe, Compliments Of My Brain</a></h3>
      <p>This website was designed to demonstrate what HTML was, and how our
        code effects the markup.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="https://dustineffinger.github.io" target="_blank">Welcome... TO MY BONES!!!</a></h3>
      <p>Now, for my <em>favorite</em> project: My Bones!! This was a personal
        project, created in IntelliJ IDEA, was designed as a way for me to
        learn how to style an HTML page with CSS and create something colorful. The content is
        absolute nonsense, but I love it.
      </p>
